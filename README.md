### What I learned

This challenge helped to test out my developemnt skills. I have used a lot of JavaScript concepts here that were known to me but I ahve used practically like bubbling. It helped my revised and learn about new CSS properties. I also managed to implement the Block, Element, Modifier methodology (commonly referred to as BEM) which is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS and this made my work a lot easioer in JavaScript. On the whole this challenge was all about learning new techniques and revising previous ones. I feel great to have landed on this site and starting this challenge.

### Useful resources

- [CodePen: Drag & Drop List Items](https://codepen.io/retrofuturistic/pen/tlbHE?editors=0010) - This is an amazing codepen which helped me to understand drag and drop API. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This reference guide helped in writing the markdown.
